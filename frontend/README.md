## Setup

If this is the first time running/building the backend, run
```
npm install
```
(this will take a while, but you should only need to do this once)  

  
Create a file in this folder called `.env`, and copy-paste the contents of `.env.template` into it.  
Set the empty fields to valid values to avoid any errors.  
  
Alternatively, set the values within the machine's environment instead of using a `.env` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies needed to run the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
